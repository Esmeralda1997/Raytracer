# Raytracer

First, I had to move some files to successfully set up this project. I added 3 png header files to the include folder: png.h, pnglibconf.h, and pngconf.h. I procedded to add their paths to the makefile to make it run successfully. 

Before I changed anything else, I went ahead and ran the file to see what was already in the window. I saw that there were already 3 circles, so I decided to change the position and size of the circles.
